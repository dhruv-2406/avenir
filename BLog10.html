                    Jesus <br>
                    At Avenir, we are continuously working on our Home Automation systems to <br> 
                    make it clean and tidy during the installation of our products in our <br> 
                    clients’ personal & professional spaces at extraordinarily high standards. <br>
    
                    So, how we go about achieving them? There are some Dos & Don’ts from <br> 
                    a technician’s viewpoint for the home automation segment which is <br> 
                    vital to be considered. Let’s understand them with some examples.

            <p> As seen in the pictures above, a normal looking distribution board (DB) has many loopholes. Let’s go
                through them one-by-one: <br>
                1.Fault: There is no use of Lugs. Effect: Short-circuit can take place. <br>
                2.Fault: There is no use of ferruling (tagging). Effect: Another technician or a layman won’t be able to
                identify a particular cable whenever necessary. <br>
                3.Fault: Minimizing the length of wire so as to avoid the use of a cable tie. Effect: Making the system
                look very unclear and untidy. <br>
                4.Fault: No usage of additional complementary accessories to make installation faster. Effect: Making
                maintenance tough and sometimes impossible which is hazardous when it comes to quality integration and
                increasing consistency of the products. <br>
                Thus, considering all these points, we can conclude that such type of systems in the home automation
                segment can take a shorter time but aesthetically & for maintenance purpose, it’s not feasible.
                Resulting in: <br>


                Low Capital Cost & High Maintenance Cost! <br>

                Now let’s go through another example where we discuss how the Distribution Board should be: <br>

                1.Use the necessary accessories and devices which will be helpful for rack installation and panel design. <br>
                2.Get the right space as per measurements & a detailed drawing of the panel. <br>
                3.Follow the ideology of 80% planning and 20% implementation, religiously and save yourselves from errors
                & wastage of resources. <br>
                4.Here listed are some of the most required things. Are your technicians using these? <br>
                a. Cable Ducts – protecting wires and hides the same in the most organized way. <br>
                b. MCBs & Connectors – detecting future problems quickly and accurately as we can easily isolate the
                faulty equipment & just work on that part without harming the rest of the solution. <br>
                c. Cable-to-cable connectors – prevent electric shock and lowering/ eliminating power losses. <br>
                d. Cable lugs – easy installation, repair and maintenance of automation devices and cables. <br>
                e. Cable Ties – for self-locking ability & cable dressing. <br>
                f. Ferruling – Tags on all the devices that create a family of product and helping all the stakeholders
                to understand the mechanism. <br>

                5. Last but not least, Automation equipment for your house! <br>

                Resulting in: <br>

                1. Greater Equipment Life Span <br>
                2. Zero Equipment Down Time <br>
                3. Optimum Capital Cost <br>
                4. Minimum Maintenance Cost <br>
                a. Energy Savings <br>
                b. Reduced Mean-time to Repair <br>
                c. Higher Mean-time between failures <br>

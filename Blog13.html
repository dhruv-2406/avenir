            <span class="text-container">
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Automation Industry which is expanding rapidly is divided <br> 
                    into 3 major segments. All of which are equally important for you to <br> 
                    understand so as to take a sound & informed decision. <br>
    
                    Those are: <br>
                    1. Manufacturers <br>
                    2. Integrators <br>
                    3. 3rd party component brands
                </p>
            </span>

    </div>

    <div class="content">
        <div class="container">
            <p> All these 3 stakeholders need to be woven together in a way that their integration within themselves
                reflect the awe-inspiring output of automation in your home/office.

                To achieve the same, one of the most important parts of the process are integrators. To make this easy
                to understand, let’s take an example:

                Right now, you would be reading this blog either on your smartphone or on your laptop. There’s a logo of
                the brand on the body of your machine. The brand would be anyone out of Apple, Samsung, Dell, OnePlus,
                Google, etc.

                What if I say, even though there are those logos embossed on the body of your machine, the majority of
                the components are not manufactured by them, in fact, they belong to some other brands. The majority of
                Smartphone camera lenses come from SONY, all android phone processors come from Qualcomm, the majority
                of the processors in your laptops are from Intel, the majority of GPU units are manufactured by Nvidia
                or AMD. Then you would imagine, if all these components are manufactured from different brands then what
                about that name/logo on your machine?

                And thus, the majority of the magic lies in the hands of the integrators, these brands you see integrate
                all the systems in one line and make them talk the same and the best language, logically in the most
                effective & efficient way.

                The very same approach is with automation integrators, there are various manufacturers like Lutron,
                which manufactures some of the world’s best products and then there comes the integrators who integrate
                those marvels in your house/office to bring the best out of it. Integrators also help to get 3rd party
                products to get in the system in the most efficient way. As we all know that there are multiple brands
                that specialize in one or the other segment and there comes the role of the integrator who can weave all
                these amazing products from amazing brands using one yarn, for you. Integrators acts a trustworthy
                bridge between all these stakeholders and ensures you of a perfect living that you have dreamt of.</p>

                    To change something, build a new model that makes the existing <br> 
                    model obsolete.’- Buckminster Fuller <br>
    
                    With this amazing quote by Mr. Fuller, I would like to tell <br> 
                    about an example that best suits this quote-‘Human Centric Lighting’. <br> 
                    The advanced features of Human Centric Lightings have overshadowed old <br> 
                    lights that had only one feature of giving brightness in a room. <br> 
                    New lights having these features serve multiple purposes at same time. <br>

            <p> Lighting is one of the principle elements of this century as it has the potential to influence the
                health and performance of employees. This decade has been the decade of innovations with new products
                being introduced that are revolutionizing all modern residential and workplaces. Human Centric Lighting
                (HCL) System is one of those innovations. <br>

                HCL is a type of lighting that helps in improving the physical as well as Emotional health of people. It
                ensures this by managing the light inside a room with accordance to sunlight throughout the day. Human
                body is habitual of changing level of light received by Sun around the clock. HCL works on Circadian
                rhythm to provide appropriate level of light to employees, helping them in increasing productivity and
                efficiency at work. Circadian rhythm is a natural, internal process that regulates the sleep-wake cycle
                and repeats roughly every 24 hours. <br>

                Apart from increasing productivity and efficiency, HCL has many other benefits. As we know that HCL

                positive impact on sleep pattern of employees which in turn has a positive impact on work performance.
                Work performance of employees has increased by 18%. Reading speed of people under HCL has also increased
                up to 30%. HCL works on the concept of working according to daylight. This helps in reducing energy
                consumption and making the concept highly sustainable. <br>

                Some other benefits of HCL include: <br>

                Reduced Hyperactivity <br>
                Saves money and Environment <br>

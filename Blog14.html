                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Home Automation isn’t a destination but a process! This means <br> 
                    it augments the lifestyle that you live right now with much more <br> 
                    comfort, convenience, style and the best aesthetics one can get. <br>
    
                    One can imagine how his/her house can be once there is someone else <br> 
                    who follows your orders to executevthose minute tasks at your house like <br> 
                    switching off the lights, unfolding the curtains, etc. How manyvtimes things <br> 
                    have not been executed in the best way or the way you expect it to happen. <br> 
                    Exact scenes orvthe atmosphere that you want in your house has rarely <br>
                    been created!

            <p> So how to get that perfect scene for your home? Basically, there are two ways of doing it. But here we
                will mainly focus only on the decentralized way of doing it. The decentralized way of doing automation
                is making one head/brain of the house where every processing takes place. This is the most efficient way
                of getting a long-lasting, effective and the robust system of automation.

                One can get started for automation by approaching the integrators and can ask for the best solution, the
                best integrator will always suggest you the best personalized and customized solution for your place.
                Automation depends on the scale of the house, requirements of people residing, people about to use the
                system, surroundings and much more. Ignorance of single aspect can cost you in terms of finance, a life
                of the product as well as its usage. As a user, we ignore the art part of the automation. Automation is
                not only about science but equally about art. Now you would be imagining how automation is also art?

                To understand this, we need to look in our daily lives, we are not those sci-fi movie’s tech buffs where
                we need high tech gadgets, which aren’t just absurd looking but not at all easy to use. Automation not
                only add more utility to your interiors, but it also adds aesthetic value to your house. It allows your
                home to behave in a much more efficient, smart and easy way. Art of the house comes into the picture
                when integrator takes care of the architect’s and owner’s vision in the mind and blends it with the
                right technology to make things easy, convenient and of much more value.

                So, to summarize this one can get started with home automation in a very simple way, finding a right
                integrator. A right integrator will help you to figure out your needs, will align the goals of all the
                stakeholders like an architect, interior designer, electrical consultant, etc. Alignment of goals makes
                the process easy and quick but for that, the most important part is beginning with the process. A
                well-known quote by Aristotle “Well begun is half done” becomes of utmost relevance and importance while
                going for Automation.</p>

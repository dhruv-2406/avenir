                Automation system controls lighting, temperature, entertainment systems and appliances. It also includes
                home security such as access control and alarm systems. Home Automation is a new concept in India which
                is slowly gathering momentum. The Smart Home concept has increased efficiency in energy consumption
                management and taking lifestyle to next level. <br>

                Home Automation has some constraints in India: <br>

                It is considered as a luxury and not a necessity to have in a house. <br>
                Lack of In-depth knowledge about home automation. <br>
                People consider it expense rather than investment. <br>
                Lack of good home automation integrator. <br>
                It is considered too much complicated. <br>
                In India, buying homes are considered to be an investment and they usually find home automation
                technology to be an accessory that is unnecessary for their household. <br>
                Let’s see what the industry experts have to say on this. <br>

                Anku Jain, Managing Director of MediaTek India said “5G will accelerate growth of smart homes, as
                connectivity will be better, lag will be less and capacity will be higher”. <br>

                Puneesh Kumar, Country Manager for Alexa Experience said “There has been a five times increase in Alexa
                Enabled Smart Home users in 2019. The selection of smart home devices has also increased Thirty times.” <br>

                In India, there is a huge market of Construction. For example, city like Mumbai, where construction
                doesn’t stop, home automation will definitely get a great exposure. <br>

                Across India, people are shifting towards smart equipments as they can take care of routine tasks –
                operating fans, lights, AC, door locks, cameras, etc. Home Automation provides you Security, Comfort,
                Convenience, Optimum utilization of devices & Luxury. It is the duty of your Integrator to take care of
                your household objective I.e. ensure minimum wastage & maximum benefit. <br>

                According to Economics Times India, the Indian smart home market is expected to be around $6 billion by
                2022, a two-fold increase from $3 billion estimated in 2020. <br>

                The Hybrid technology helps the integrator in not only installing the system with ease but also helps
                the user in saving money by making the system energy efficient. Going for whether wired or wireless
                system depends upon the user’s budget, work scale and installation policy. Availability of uninterrupted
                Wi-Fi services in the country has also propelled the growth of home automation products in India. App
                based control over switches, lighting devices, Entertainment system and audio video control are widely
                used products in Home Automation industry. Devices like Google Home, Amazon Alexa voice over control
                devices are making home automation more attractive. <br>

                This niche segment in India is witnessing a larger acceptance due to availability of affordable and
                durable products that do not require wiring, can be installed to control few appliances and can be
                scaled up as per requirement. As home automation is an emerging market, and India being the country with
                the highest potential for this market, the global players are expected to extend their businesses in
                India. <br></p>

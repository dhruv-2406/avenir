                    How Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning & Home Automation <br> is different but complimentary?

                    Artificial Intelligence is a technique that emphasizes the machine to <br> mimic human behaviour. According
                    to John McCarthy, <br>
    
                    Every aspect of learning can be so precisely described that a machine <br> 
                    can be made to stimulate it. An attempt to make machine use language, <br> 
                    form abstractions & concepts, solve some kind of human problems & <br>
                    improve themselves. <br>

            <p> Virtual Assistants like Apple’s Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, Google Maps, Smart Robots are the best
                examples of Artificial Intelligence. <br>

                Machine Learning is a subset of AI and makes data-driven decisions to carry out a specific task. It’s a
                simple algorithm that enables the software to improve its performance. <br>

                Let’s understand Machine Learning by an example,<br>
                Suppose we taught a computer to recognize the word ‘Avenir’ in many different styles, different fonts &
                different ways in the English Language by setting an algorithm. Now if any user uses that word the
                computer will automatically understand that word in any different style/font. But it wouldn’t be able to
                recognize the same word in other languages.<br>

                In Simple words, let’s imagine a child is taught to play a tune with a particular Key and with time he
                becomes an expert in it. Now if we tell that child to play the same tune with different Key, what will
                happen? He will not be able to play that tune.<br>

                In the same way, machine learning is an algorithm defined for a specific task to be performed and gains
                expertize in the same specific task. By setting an algorithm we are making an organized system for that
                specific task.<br>

                Automation is the process by which you can effectively operate the equipment by an algorithm or
                programming software to perform particular tasks with minimum human effort. Automation makes life more
                convenient by reducing the human effort.<br>

                Machine Learning is a technique for Artificial Intelligence & Artificial Intelligence is a tool for
                Automation.<br>

                Let’s decode,<br>
                Imagine, entering in a pitch dark room!<br>

                We have to manually switch on the lights, but what if the light turns on automatically when we enter the
                room. It will be more convenient and easier. The process of lights getting on/off automatically is
                automation.<br>

                At home, we can control the Air conditioner, Lightning System, Shades, etc. by using Virtual Assistant
                Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa etc. This means that AI is a tool for Automation.<br>

                Suppose the curtains automatically open during the sunrise and close at the time of sunset, that means
                that you have machine learning as a technique to perform Automation.</p>

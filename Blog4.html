            <span class="text-container">
                <p style="font-size: 20px;">As Quoted by Cecelia Ahern “Home isn’t a place, it’s a feeling” <br> 
                    and how can one feel great when coming home doesn’t tend to be relaxing <br> 
                    and one has to switch and adjust Lights, A.C, Curtains manually after a <br>
                    long tiring day? On other hands, a home welcomes you with pre-adjusted <br> 
                    temperature, perfect curtains, properly dimmed light and your favorite <br> 
                    music. Sounds peaceful, Isn’t it? <br>
    
                    That’s when Home Automation comes into the picture. <br>
    
                    Your home can be personalized to the level you have never thought of. <br> 
                    One of the most compelling features of home automation is the ability <br> 
                    to press one button that spawns multiple actions. Upgrading the <br> 
                    traditional switchboards with the personalized keypads where <br> 
                    your customized actions are engraved on it in your language, <br> 
                    pattern, button shapes and labels. <br>
                </p>

            <p> Let’s understand with an example, there’s a dedicated Home Theater in your home with beautiful Interiors
                with all the equipped technologies. From acoustics to the sound system to the screen to the projector.
                And with so many equipment comes so many remote controls. How about a single button in the entrance
                operate the entire room? With “Entertain” engraved on the button when pressed, all the curtains come
                down, lights are dimmed at 10% for first 2-3 minutes giving enough brightness for everyone to settle; AC
                temperature set at 24 degrees; projector, screen, speakers turning ON. You select your preferred
                movie/show and the lights turn OFF. <br>

                And thus, minimum 5 functions took place with a single button which otherwise would have taken 5
                different remotes and an expert to control them all! <br>



                In another instance, let’s say it’s your bedroom, the button on the Keypad has been engraved for you as
                “Goodnight”. This will put your home to sleep with a simple touch. All the doors in the home will be
                locked, interior lights and televisions will turn off, the temperature is set back to a comfortable
                sleeping temperature you want, the alarm system will be armed, and the perimeter lights of home (the
                landscape lights) will turn on. <br>

                And just like that, multiple scenes can be activated. You can also create scenes for hours of the day,
                movie nights, reading sessions etc. Sky is the limit! Because it’s meant to be for You. <br>

                Scenes are single touch settings that set multiple functions at once and create a perfect one for You.
                It has predefined settings for lights, curtains, temperature, music, or whatever you choose. You can
                select and customize the functions yourself, to achieve the perfect ambient that suits your needs, from
                time to time. <br>

                Personalization options aren’t merely limited to devices in and around the home; homeowners can also
                quickly and easily set up triggers that send push notifications to their smartphones as well. Parents
                might choose to receive a pop-up alert when their kids unlock the front door at the end of the school
                day. Having Digital Video Door Phones is always a smart idea. You can see who is standing in front of
                your door when you’re enjoying your holiday in Europe. You can also communicate with them in real-time
                and unlock your home door for them if you want to. <br>

                Last but not the least, Smart home gives the sense of luxury, a luxury which can be seen, felt and
                appreciated. All of these things make for a better living experience in your home. When small things are
                being taken care of, less time is spent on adjusting the room as per your mood and more time with your
                family and friends, for your interest and comfort. <br>

                Home Automation is for You. It needs to Simplify things for You. It needs to lessen your tedious work.
                It needs to Understand You! <br>

                So, when you make your new home or renovate the existing one, make sure you have got a 100% Personalized
                Experience! <br></p>

                    nor the most intelligent one, but the one most responsive to change.’ <br>

                    As the humankind is facing its biggest existential crisis since World War II, <br>
                    COVID 19 has disrupted the way people live all around the world. <br>
                    Few weeks ago, no one in their wildest dream would have thought <br>
                    about a global lockdown which would force more than half of global <br>
                    population to stay home. This was unpredicted, appalling, distressing <br>
                    and will have a long lasting effect on people, society, businesses, <br>
                    and the global economy at large scale.But every cloud has a silver <br>
                    lining and COVID 19 was a blessing for all of us to strengthen <br>

            <p> all companies is to go for new business technologies during this crisis. Organizations should create new
                business models that will impact
                all components of performance. Use of technologies like Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning
                have become the lifeline for a large
                set of companies worldwide to ensure business continuity and offering uninterrupted services to their
                customers. <br>

                In spite of global recession, there are some companies that have adapted well to the situation and doing
                better than before. These businesses are taking a second look at how they are positioning themselves in
                the market and how their current operations can be improved ensuring the safety of their employees and
                customers. For example, Pizza chains like Dominos and Papa John’s have adopted no contact delivery
                method. They are accepting online orders only. Papa John is offering a touchless experience for pizza
                delivery and their ‘Papa Truck’ is fully functioning for customers who want better insight into their
                orders. They haven’t slowed down their operations, but instead kept pushing forward and investing in
                their people and technology. They are also offering custom drop-off points. Customers can indicate where
                exactly they would prefer their order to be left by a delivery person — it can be left by the front
                door, on a bench, at a reception desk, or whatever is easiest and more comfortable. Apart from these
                two, food companies like First Choice, Boka, Eden East and J.W Lopes were quick in adapting these
                measures to run their business smoothly amid lockdown. <br>

                COVID 19 lockdown came as a blessing in disguise for OTT platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. With
                everyone stuck at home and theaters shut down for a long time, everyone prefers watching their favorite
                movies and web series on these platforms. Film makers are releasing their movies directly on these
                platforms instead of waiting for theaters to re-open. In this way, film makers are also not suffering
                losses due to delay in their film’s release. <br>



                Although Covid-19 has significantly impacted the beauty industry, makeup continues to play an important
                role in many people’s lives as part of their desire to look and feel their best. MAC Cosmetics has been
                working with YouCam to roll out AR smart mirrors in its stores since the end of 2017, and only 2.6% of
                stores are currently equipped. It introduced an AR try-on tool through a dedicated website tab in August
                2019. MAC’s AR try-on tool comes at a time when shopping habits and the retail environment continues to
                change post-coronavirus shutdowns. The company is hoping its AR-play will be used as an Omni-channel
                tool moving forward. <br>

                Technology is playing its role in helping almost every business in surviving this recession. Many
                businesses have started accepting orders online or over the phone. Companies like Amazon and Flipkart
                have started delivering products with the help of drones to avoid human contact. Even small businesses
                have started accepting online payments to avoid cash transaction. Educational institutes have started
                giving online classes to students via applications like Zoom. The graph given below indicates the
                increase in online customers across different sectors during lockdown. <br>



                As people stay at home, consumers have shifted from personal interactions, where they provide direct
                feedback, to digital interactions. As it’s no longer possible to eat out, they’ll be ordering online
                deliveries. Going to shops to buy clothes might be risky, so they would prefer shopping online. The same
                pattern is being replicated in sectors across the globe. That’s where AI comes into picture and helps us
                to find out what customers feel and need. <br>

                Not only in understanding consumer behavior, this technology can also help businesses post COVID 19 to
                manage their demand and supply. For example, a big steel company has information about the various
                factors that might influence demand for steel, such as the demand for automobiles. This data can be used
                to match up to what their supply chains can produce. In this way the company is not producing more than
                needed and not leaving unfulfilled demand too. <br>

                Now, more than ever, it’s important for companies to understand the environment we’re living in and
                adapt to it. These are the companies that will not only survive during the pandemic but get ahead of
                their competition. <br></p>

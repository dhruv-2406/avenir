                    – Nabil Sabio Azadi. <br>

                    Life as we knew changed on midnight of 24th March when Prime Minister <br> 
                    Mr.Narendra Modi announced a lockdown of 21 days to <br> 
                    prevent the spread of COVID19 throughout the country. Despite of <br>
                    enormous attempts by the government, the virus travelled quickly <br> 
                    to various parts of the country and Prime Minister had no other <br> 
                    choice than extending it till 3rd May. Everyone except those <br> 
                    working in Healthcare sector and food production were not <br> 
                    allowed to leave their homes.

            <p> This seemed as a wonderful opportunity to binge watch our favorite shows lying on a sofa with some
                snacks and cold drinks. But instead this can also be seen as an opportunity to develop skills, learn new
                things, and invest time on innovative ideas that can later be turned into something big. It is the time
                to do the things we couldn’t do in daily life schedule.

                Children can use this time to learn skills like reading and writing that are going to be useful for them
                throughout their lives. College students can spend their time doing new courses that would give them
                practical knowledge and enrich their profiles. Elders should invest some time taking care of their
                health. Yoga and meditation can help them to keep their body and mind calm at the time of pandemic.

                Before starting anything productive, it is of utmost importance that we keep our physical and mental
                health stable. It can be done by keeping our body routine same as it was before the lockdown. Apart from
                that daily exercise or Yoga can be an ideal solution.

                In the time when everyone has been quarantined, one thing that has helped us to stay connected to the
                outer world is Technology. Online video platforms like Skype and Duo has helped employees to conduct
                online meetings. With the help of Zoom application, teachers are able to teach their whole class at once
                by just sitting at their homes. Online streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video have made this time
                a little less boring. Social media has helped us to stay in touch with our friends and relatives.

                Apart from just entertainment and connection, Technology can be used to make this time productive. There
                are many platforms on the internet that can help us to learn things easily by staying at home. Some
                things on which we can invest our time during the lockdown are:-

                Build your Resume: There are many sites on the internet like edX, Coursera, that offer free online
                courses where learners are just supposed to attend online classes on any interested topic and give small
                tests at the end of lectures. These courses help in learning new skills that can be later useful and
                implemented at workplace. Learners also get a certificate at the end of the course which adds value to
                their resume.
                Invest time on Startup ideas: Many times we think of starting a new business with an innovative idea but
                are not able to do it due to lack of clear vision. Now, it is the right time to do researches, contact
                the right people and go ahead with your plan. Come up with ways of making your idea different from
                others’. Reading the stories of successful startups can also help you in coming up with some amazing
                ideas.
                Learn a new language: If learning a new or a foreign language has been in your bucket list, it is right
                time to tick it off. With a wide selection of videos and online tutorials on YouTube, you can learn any
                language. All you need is a phone and internet connection.
                Learn to play an instrument: There is nothing more stress relieving than playing an instrument. It is
                believed that everyone should learn playing at least one instrument. With so much free time, it’s never
                been easier to pick up a new skill. YouTube videos and online tutorials can help you out in this too.
                Write your Autobiography: Doing this will serve two purposes; you can improve your writing skills and
                also know what you have done so far in life and what else you want to do.
                There is no harm in spending some time to relax and chill but it is also important that we come out of
                this lockdown with some new skills and learning that would help us to be even more productive.

                Spend some time with family. Stay Home, Stay Safe. </p>

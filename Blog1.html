                <p style="font-size: 20px;">Can you imagine your life without Natural light and the peace it gives <br> 
                    to your soul? Obviously, the answer is NO. <br> 
                    Natural Light is one of the most precious things that nature has given us. <br> 
                    In today’s life, with social activities expanding, people require <br> 
                    reliable lighting during all hours of the day and night BUT in this <br> 
                    era of Industrialisation, and now COVID – 19, it is equivalent to risking your <br> 
                    life by going out and enjoying the beautiful natural light. <br>
                    Light makes us see and appreciate the beauty around us and <br> 
                    also increases the release of serotonin, which is known as the happy <br> 
                    hormone and further helps to have a better mood, <br> 
                    as well as feel focused and calm. </p>

                <p> If the exposure to it is in perfect proportion it helps to prevent Cancer, increase your metabolism
                    rate
                    and enhances your physical and mental health. Now the big question which comes in our mind is how
                    can we
                    get perfect Natural light in our home which uplifts our mood without damaging our skin? <br>

                    Here comes, Smart Lighting Solution. In last few years, Smart Lighting Solution has become the
                    priority
                    of every smart home owner. It connects your lighting devices and adjusts them depending on the
                    ambient
                    daylight intensity. Apart from ambience there is a huge scientific logic behind Smart Lighting
                    control
                    system. Smart Lighting Solution is designed for both, Workplaces and Homes. <br>

                    Workplaces
                    In a workspace, Conference Room can be a space to exchange ideas, view multimedia presentations,
                    teleconferences etc.And if a presenter wants to incorporate a video into their meeting, he just
                    needs to
                    push a button labelled “A/V,” which will dim the lights, close the shades and lower the projection
                    screen. Once the video has ended pushing “Meeting” button brighten the lights and raise the shades
                    for a
                    better scenario to field questions. <br>

                    According to a new study conducted by Alan Hedge, a professor in the Department of Design and
                    Environmental Analysis at Cornell, workers in day lit office environments reported an 84 percent
                    drop in
                    symptoms of eyestrain, headaches and blurred vision symptoms, which can detract from productivity.
                    <br>

                    And another survey from Future Workplace shows that over 1,600 employees ranked “access to natural
                    light
                    and views of the outdoors” as their number one desire for a workplace environment. <br>

                    Residences
                    In our homes, Smart Lighting Solution can regulate the natural light which comes from outside to
                    your
                    room. When you wake up in the morning you are suddenly exposed to very high quantity of light by
                    manually switching to your light bulbs which inhibits your Brain’s natural process of working. On
                    other
                    hand, when you have Smart Lighting solution you just press “Good Morning” button and your curtains
                    will
                    drag allowing the low intensity natural light to come into your room and make you feel the freshness
                    of
                    nature just sitting in your home and when the optimum sunlight meets a minimum desired level, lights
                    are
                    turned off. Once it gets dark outside, lights are turned back on. So, switching will usually occur
                    only
                    twice a day – at the beginning and at the end of it. <br>

                    According to Brenda Mc Mahon, MD of the Neurobiology Research Unit at the Copenhagen University
                    Hospital, Denmark, “If people are exposed to light in the morning that mimics the wavelengths of
                    daylight, they become better at coping with anxiety-provoking experiences. The light simply improves
                    the
                    communication between the regions of the brain that are central to our handling of emotions such as
                    stress and anxiety”. <br>


                    Combining Natural daylight and artificial light provides a constant, optimised lighting environment
                    which improves wellbeing of occupants. You can enjoy the warmth of natural light, while not having
                    to
                    deal with unnecessary light pollution generated by luminaires. <br>

                    So, Make Sunlight your spotlight with a sophisticated daylight control system and take full
                    advantage of
                    beautiful natural light along with other sources by putting flexibility at your fingertips! No
                    wires, no
                    batteries, no limits!The end result is excellent energy savings potential that cuts your energy
                    bills
                    and adds an unexpected boost to your mental and physical health. <br>

                    Has it ever been easier than today on such a large scale? We think not!

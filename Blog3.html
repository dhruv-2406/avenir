            <p> What Millennial think of Home Automation? <br>

                It is not really surprising that millennial want smart home technology, but a recent study conducted by
                Wakefield Research has confirmed it. Their findings show that 86% of millennial are ready to pay more
                for a home or rental property if it has smart home technology.
                In fact, millennial are happy to pay an average 20% more in order to secure a home with smart
                technology. They like electronic access, keyless locks, interconnected doorbells, phone controlled
                security systems, voice activated assistants, and much more.
                According to a Neilson global online study, almost 75% of millennial are ready to pay extra for
                sustainable offerings, and Generation Z is also committed to a positive environmental impact. These
                young generations of future will demand sustainable offerings in home, and home automation is a simple
                way to improve energy efficiency and match these future home buyer’s needs.
                According to The Washington Post, 54% of home buyers say that if they have to choose between two
                identical houses, one with smart technology, the other without, they would buy the smart home. The post
                also specified a massive survey of 22,000 home owners done by John Burns Real Estate Consulting which
                found that not only do potential buyers rank smart technology high when they evaluate housing options;
                they are also prepared to pay thousands of dollars for it. <br>

                Price is still rumination. It seems that everyone wants the trendy technologies, but it is often only
                those with bigger budgets who can afford it. Although this is changing as systems become more
                affordable. <br>

                each year. <br>

                lives. <br>

                Luxury. Home automation can touch just above every detail of your home, helping to create an enriched
                lifestyle & a comfortable surrounding. So the question shouldn’t be “why should I invest in a home
                automation system?” rather, “why wouldn’t I invest in a home automation system?”. <br>

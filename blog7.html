                <p style="font-size: 20px;">“No one is more cherished in this world than someone who <br> 
                    lightens the burden of others.” – Joseph Addison <br>

                    Truly said and nothing could be the best example than “Virtual Assistant” <br> 
                    which is helping people to lessen their burdens and to do everything <br> 
                    with ease. Who in this world had ever thought of talking to a <br>
                    machine that interacts and facilitates one’s task? <br>
    
                    Contrary to a popular belief, Virtual Assistants didn’t start with the <br> 
                    launch of Amazon Echo. The Virtual voice revolution started back in 1961 <br> 
                    when IBM introduced IBM Shoebox which recognised only 16 words and <br> 
                    digits. Siri was the first Virtual Assistant to reach a wide audience <br> 
                    and it was the first time when an interaction of smart phones and voice <br> took place.

            <p> Google Now and Microsoft’s Cortana soon
                followed. Then in 2014, Amazon introduced the Alexa Virtual Assistant and Echo smart speaker. The
                Virtual Assistant concept got a big boom in the year 2016 when Google and Amazon gave their Virtual
                Assistant a real Face to the Voice. And the Industry is estimated to grow with a larger pace soon. <br>

                According to Cisco, connected home applications such as home automation/security/video surveillance and
                tracking applications will represent 46% or nearly half of the total M2M connections by 2021 and no
                doubt Virtual Assistant will play a tremendous role in it. <br>

                Due to the ever-expanding applications of Virtual Assistant, it will not only change our work but will
                also change the way we live in our homes. Gadgets like Amazon’s Echo and Google home connects different
                devices through the Internet of Things (IoT) by voice command, that’s called a Connected home. <br>

                When it comes to convenience and its benefits for differently-abled and aged people nothing can beat
                home automation with a voice assistant. <br>

                The role of Virtual Assistant in home automation is not only restricted to convenience, its application
                in home security and energy efficiency is ripe for disruption. <br>

                With the introduction of Siri, no one could have predicted that this novelty would become a driver for
                tech innovation. Now nearly nine years later, it is estimated that one in every six Americans own a
                smart speaker (Google Home, Amazon Echo) and eMarketer forecasts that nearly 100 million smart phone
                users will be using Virtual Assistants in 2021. <br>

                It is not going to stop here it will even boost with some futuristic features that are challenges today
                – <br>

                Change in Search Behaviour -Visibility of voice will undoubtedly be a challenge. This is because the
                visual interface with Virtual Assistants is missing. Users simply cannot see or touch a voice interface
                unless it is connected to Alexa or Google Assistant app. <br>
                Individualized Experiences- Google Home can support up to six user accounts and detect unique voices,
                which allow Google Home users to customize many features. What about the family of more than six people
                or a company with hundreds of employees? <br>
                Security and Privacy- Forty-one per cent of Virtual Assistant users are concerned about trust and
                privacy according to a report from Microsoft. Verification and ID will also become paramount as part of
                the Virtual Assistant experience with more security being built around the user. <br>
                The one thing that we can say is that the evolution of intelligent personal assistants (IPAs) has come
                up as a perfect precursor to automate homes. For instance, with the third-party intervention to develop
                Alexa skills, Amazon Echo has become more robust. Google Home has a huge ecosystem in its favour and
                thus has the advantage of being integrated with a search engine, email accounts, and other products. <br></p>
